AI Track

Objective

Push the boundaries of what's possible with Artificial Intelligence. Your focus should be on creativity, novelty, and technical innovation, not necessarily market-readiness.

Tool Freedom: You have complete freedom to use any AI models, APIs, or tools you wish (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, custom models).

Creativity is Key: We welcome both artistic/creative applications and novel productivity/utility tools. The goal is to surprise us!

Project Ideas (for inspiration):

An AI tool that generates personalized bedtime stories from user prompts (e.g., "a story about a brave knight and a friendly dragon").
An interactive art piece that uses an image model to change its visuals based on real-time news headlines.
A productivity tool that listens to your meeting transcript and automatically generates

Documentation Requirements

This can be a simple text file or section in your README
